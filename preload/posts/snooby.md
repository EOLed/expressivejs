Introducing [Snooby](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/23060906/), the very early 
stages of a Blackberry 10 Reddit client. As it stands, it's a read-only Reddit client... capable
of only browsing the front page or the subreddits that you are subscribed to.

##Philosphy
The philosphy of Snooby is to release early and often. New versions of Snooby will be submitted 
to the BlackBerry App World frequently with hopes of receiving feedback and letting its users
guide its development.

##Progress and Known Issues
Snooby is [open-source](http://github.com/achan/snooby) and its 
[issue tracking is also public](https://github.com/achan/snooby/issues?state=open). Development 
mainly happens on the [1.1.x branch](https://github.com/achan/snooby/tree/1.1.x) and 
[master](https://github.com/achan/snooby/tree/master) usually contains the latest released 
version.

**I'm aware that v1.0 is terrible :)** I developed and submitted it using solely an emulator to
test my code. When I finally got my hands on a BlackBerry Z10, I was appalled at its performance
and had I known this earlier, probably wouldn't have released it to begin with! Versions 
1.0.1 and 1.0.2 (both waiting for approval in the App World) address some of the performance 
issues. The biggest performance issue -- comment loading -- is still being worked on.

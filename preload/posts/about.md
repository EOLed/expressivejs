Hi, my name is **Amos Chan**. I'm a software developer specializing in enterprise Java web applications for my 9-5, but by night I like to dive into the wild, dynamically-typed world of programming for [my personal side projects](http://github.com/achan).

## Notable Side Projects

### Did Gomez Score Last Game? [+](http://didgomezscore.com)

A light-hearted website [built with Node.js and Redis](http://github.com/achan/didgomezscore) with the intentions of withstanding [viral traffic](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/congratulations-canadiens-scott-gomez-one-anniversary-last-goal-211326566.html) with minimal downtime.

### Expressive: The ExpressJS Blogging Engine [+](http://github.com/achan/expressivejs)

A minimal blogging engine running on ExpressJS. `npm install expressive && expressive` * and you're good to go!

### Churchie: A CakePHP CMS [+](http://github.com/achan/mcac)

Yet another CakePHP CMS engine that provides the notion of users, roles and groups. Users have roles. Certain roles can post to groups. Groups have pages. Anybody can subscribe to groups.

\* soon :)

Hi, my name is **Amos Chan**. I'm a software developer specializing in enterprise Java web 
applications for my 9-5, but by night I like to dive into the wild, dynamically-typed world 
of programming for [my side projects](http://github.com/achan).

## Notable Side Projects

### Snooby: A Blackberry 10 Reddit Client [+](http://github.com/achan/snooby)

[Snooby](http://am05.com/2013/02/20/introducing-snooby-a-blackberry-10-reddit-client) is the 
first Blackberry 10 Reddit Client available on the [Blackberry App World](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/23060906/) 
that is not an Android port.

### Did Gomez Score Last Game? [+](http://didgomezscore.com)

A light-hearted website [built with Node.js and Redis](http://github.com/achan/didgomezscore) 
with the intentions of withstanding [viral traffic](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/congratulations-canadiens-scott-gomez-one-anniversary-last-goal-211326566.html) 
with minimal downtime.

### Expressive: The ExpressJS Blogging Engine [+](http://github.com/achan/expressivejs)

A minimal blogging engine running on ExpressJS. `npm install expressive && expressive` * and 
you're good to go!

### Churchie: A CakePHP CMS [+](http://github.com/achan/mcac)

Yet another CakePHP CMS engine that provides the notion of users, roles and groups. Users 
have roles. Certain roles can post to groups. Groups have pages. Anybody can subscribe to groups.

### android-reddit [+](http://github.com/achan/android-reddit)

An Android library wrapping Reddit's [publicly available REST API](http://www.reddit.com/dev/api). 
This library will parse Reddit's JSON responses into Java objects like `Subreddit`, `Link`, 
`Comment`, etc. Currently used by the up and coming [Reddit Flow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deeptrouble.yaarreddit) 
Android app.

\* soon :)
